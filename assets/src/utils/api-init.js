/* global loggedin */

/**
 * Configure `@wordpress/api-fetch` for the plugin's REST surface.
 *
 * The PHP side (`Admin\Assets::script_vars()`) localises a `loggedin`
 * global containing the REST nonce. We attach it via the nonce
 * middleware so every outgoing request carries `X-WP-Nonce` and the
 * REST permission callbacks see an authenticated user.
 *
 * We intentionally do NOT install a custom root-URL middleware: the
 * WordPress-bundled `wp-api-fetch` is already configured against the
 * site's `/wp-json/` root, so calling `apiFetch({ path: '/loggedin/v1/addons' })`
 * resolves correctly out of the box. Layering a second root-URL
 * middleware that also injects the namespace into the path leads to
 * "No route was found" errors when something slips through with
 * just `'addons'` as the path.
 *
 * The function is a no-op when the `loggedin` global is missing —
 * for example, when the bundle is loaded in a unit-test context.
